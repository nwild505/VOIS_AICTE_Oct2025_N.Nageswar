## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb booking data to uncover trends in bookings, pricing, guest preferences, and host performance. By exploring the data, we provide actionable insights that can help hosts optimize their listings, improve guest satisfaction, and make informed decisions.  

The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and summary insights. This project is implemented in Python using Google Colab for easy execution and sharing.

## Key Features
- Analyze **booking trends** over time and across locations  
- Examine **pricing strategies** and seasonal variations  
- Understand **guest preferences** and most desired amenities  
- Identify **high-performing hosts** and measure responsiveness  
- Create **geo-visualizations** to map listings and pricing density

## Technologies Used
- **Python** — primary programming language  
- **Pandas, NumPy** — data manipulation and numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** — visualization and interactive plots  
- **Google Colab** — cloud environment for analysis  
- **CSV/Excel** — dataset input and cleaned data storage

## Dataset
The analysis uses Airbnb booking datasets (Excel/CSV format) containing listing information such as:
- Price per night
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Room type
- Amenities
- Number of reviews and review dates
- Host information and responsiveness

> **Note:** Upload your dataset when running the notebook in Colab.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload your Airbnb Excel dataset when prompted.  
3. Run each cell sequentially to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
4. Download the cleaned dataset and summary files for further use.

## Insights & Deliverables
- Cleaned Airbnb dataset ready for analysis  
- Visualizations of booking patterns, pricing trends, guest preferences, and host performance  
- Summary CSV highlighting key metrics for hosts and listings  
- Geo-visualizations showing density and pricing across locations
